            We are Looper! Nigeria&apos;s first surplus food platform Looper was born
            from a simple but powerful observation: at the end of every day, so
            much delicious, fresh food is lost. <br />
            That didn&apos;t sit right with us; so, we decided to do something about
            it.
            <br />
            <br /> At Looper, we connect restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and
            food vendors that have surplus food with people that need food.
            We&apos;re not just another food company; we&apos;re here to provide amazing
            food at the best prices.
            <br />
            <br /> Our mission is to make sustainability feel easy and familiar,
            help people access good food at low prices and support local
            businesses.
            <br /> Our success isn&apos;t measured in profit but in the strength of
            the positive feedback loop we create for our society. <br />
            We are here to ensure that yummy food completes its journeyâ€”into the
            bellies of people. : )
